cursor.snapshot()

    Append the snapshot() method to a cursor to toggle the “snapshot” mode. This ensures that the query will not return a document multiple times, even if intervening write operations result in a move of the document due to the growth in document size.

    Warning

        You must apply snapshot() to the cursor before retrieving any documents from the database.
        You can only use snapshot() with unsharded collections.

    The snapshot() does not guarantee isolation from insertion or deletions.

    The snapshot() traverses the index on the _id field. As such, snapshot() cannot be used with sort() or hint().

    Queries with results of less than 1 megabyte are effectively implicitly snapshotted.
